Wow....where to start? Well i guess with what i thought went into designing
an operating system.  What i thought was much simpler than whta went into even
our basic baseline system ending at week 4.  I figured we could have done what
we had originally thought about, a system that is able to migrate high load
tasks to other machines on the network.  I found out that a lot of the what
are normally simpple tasks are very hard as there is little or no debugging
that can be done when implementing a system like this.

I originally set out to do 3 major projects, firtual file system, fat64 file
system, and the ide driver.  The virtual file system was completely trashed as
it was 1) taking too much of the time and 2) was tending to be too difficult to
find good resources on.  The file system I originally wrote without being able
to test most of the code that later turned out not working and was re-written
from scratch, though didn't have every userland function implemented and if was
used wouldn't compile.  The IDE driver even took up more time than i thought,
as there is next to no documentation for Serial IDE devices and when doing polled
i/o you have to tell each device (instead of channel of 2 devices) to not cause
interrupts

if i had to redo this project, i would start from the ground and work up by
starting with the ide driver, then the file system, and then if i had time the
VFS.  My reasoning for this is so i can test everything with the other code
instead of having to test it in the stand alone or a real OS (ie linux).

After being in this class for 10 weeks i have grown more fond of systems
development than i previously was and would like to actually pursue a career in
this type of programing and development.

all in all i have learned the most in this class than any other have have taken
since being a college student.  It was also a bunch of fun, though frustrating at
times, but very satisfying to see it work all at the last second and have a
"working" (yes those are finger quotes) operating system.
