==== Screens ====
Author: Benjamin Mayes

The screens system allows for each process to have its own dedicated drawing
space and input buffers (both mouse and keyboard).

Features
1. Using system calls a user process is able to get and set its own screen, 
   open and close new screens, and switch to a different active (shown 
   screen). Children inherit their parent's screen (users spawned by init
   share screen 0).
        Religious Debate: It may not be desirable to have children share a
        screen in this fashion.
2. Input multiplexing: Keyboard and mouse input will be buffered in the buffer
   of the active screen. c_io functions involving keyboard input and the io
   functions for getting mouse input take advantage of these buffers.
        Issues: I broke c_io keyboard input when interrupts are not enabled.
        This was not a large enough issue to fix though.
3. Output multiplexing: gs_io functions will write to the correct buffer.
   (if the screen is not the active screen it'll write to a framebuffer in
    memory, if it is the active screen it'll write the video memory)
        Issues: There is a small window of vulnerability where the wrong buffer
        will be written to if a buffer is swapped in/out of memory at the wrong
        time. I wrote mutexes to try to solve this but afterwards I realized
        that there was no good approach to fixing this issue using them.

Under the hood the active and inactive handles are queued up for easy access.
In hindsight this wasn't necessary but since it worked fine right off the bat
I can't say I wasted time taking this approach.

All things considered - the screen system turned out great. It is incredibly
simple to build more powerful shells or window managers on top of that further
buffer the input. For an effective demo, see the screen_manager function.

The screens system introduced 5 system calls:
handle_t getscreen();
handle_t setscreen(handle_t screen); 
handle_t switchscreen(handle_t screen); 
handle_t openscreen();
status_t closescreen();

For more information about these system calls look them up in the 
syscall/screen directory.
